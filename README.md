#Use this at your own peril

This is a handful of patches I collected from various support tickets to fix builds on my PowerPC based 10.4 Tiger system.  To wit:

python313: https://trac.macports.org/ticket/71206?cversion=1&cnum_hist=19 -- credit to @glebm
m4: https://trac.macports.org/ticket/72527 -- credit to @hart-NTP

These popped up as they are in the prereq list for doing the local build of @classilla's fabulous TenFourFox project: https://github.com/classilla/tenfourfox?tab=readme-ov-file

Perhaps this is useful.
